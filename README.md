Website: https://weather-app-roan-nine-74.vercel.app

This is an application that fetches and displays weather data for a user-specified city using the Visual Crossing API. The app is designed with a sleek, Apple-inspired UI, featuring a clean interface, backdrop filters, and modern typography. This project served as a learning experience in integrating APIs, managing state in React, and applying advanced CSS techniques.
